**Synopsis:**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
To alleviate overpopulation in comprehensive hospital and improve the efficiency of medical services, Chinese government has prompted the hierarchical healthcare service systems. However, medical resource allocation and bidirectional referral strategies remain key issues to be solved in this emergent medical form. In this study, a medical resource planning model based on a stochastic bidirectional referral service network is presented, in which the burden of medical resources and the quality of health care are considered simultaneously. In addition, several cases including first-visit scale redistribution, referral rate and service rate sensitivity analysis are conducted. Finally, we provide an effective heuristic method to obtain the optimal resource allocation scheme and a series of constructive decision supported insights are discussed.

**Results:**
- With a developed intelligent heuristic algorithm, the experiments show that we can obtain various Pareto solutions that achieve different cost and utility levels.
